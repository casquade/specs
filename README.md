# Workflow/Pipeline Markup

- should be easy to parse for most of the programing languages
- should able to specify machine environments for each step
- should NOT have many ways to describe one thing
- should focus on practical workflows and pipelines

# ppmp

- is an acronym of "Practical Pipeline Markup Protocol"
- is NOT a syntax nor a language
- is just a protocol of writing [YAML](http://yaml.org/) and [JSON](http://json.org/)
  - to define and share workflow and pipeline

# this repository

- specifies how to write YAML/JSON according to "PPMP"
- specifies examples of PPMP protocoled YAML/JSON
- introduces how to run PPMP protocoled YAML/JSON by [sample engine](https://github.com/ppmp/engine)
